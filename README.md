# gnsc3301-GroupProject2023
This repository is for my group computing project. It will be used to keep track of who aids is which parts of the project and to also keep all of the information in one place. 
We have successfully shared the repository in GitHub and are both able to access it. We will both add information collected from our Capstone project to keep everything organized. 

I'm here!

Progress:
  Preslea and I (Alissa) have created a GitHub repository that works effectively, along with a folder for our project in Rstudio. Both of us have access to makes changes within Rstudio and GitHub. We both have also made SSH keys to communicate with our computers cohesively. We have researched code that might be helpful for making the most effective ANOVA for our capstone. We have not found any code that we will actually utilize, but are still in the process of researching.
